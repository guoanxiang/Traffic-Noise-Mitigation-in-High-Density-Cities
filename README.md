# Traffic-Noise-Mitigation-in-High-Density-Cities
A psychoacoustic study of trees, rooftop gardens, facades, and water features conducted in Summer 2025

## Abstract
Urban noise pollution poses critical health risks in high-density cities like Singapore, where traffic noise dominates residential environments. This study evaluates the effectiveness of four mitigation strategies. They are roadside trees, rooftop gardens, corrugated facades, and water features. Integrated acoustic (A/C/Z-weighted SPL) and psychoacoustic parameters (loudness, sharpness, roughness) are used in this evaluation. 

Field recordings showed low frequencies below 100 Hz that are less audible to the human ear to be at a higher $L_{eq}$ than mid and high frequencies. Heightened emphasis is placed to find methods to curb these low frequencies. 

Comparisons of the 10 sites revealed that rooftop gardens were most effective in reducing A-weighted SPL (up to 14.5\% reduction) and loudness (12.9â€“17.3 sone decrease). In particular, well-designed rooftop gardens were most useful, being the only site with significant decreases in $LC_{eq}$ (11.13\% reduction) and $LZ_{eq}$ (10.26\% reduction).

Trees reduced mid-frequency noise (7.47\% $LA_{eq}$ reduction) but were ineffective for low frequencies (< 3.5\% $LZ_{eq}$ reduction) and lost efficacy at higher elevations.

Similar to trees, facades offered moderate mid-frequency reduction (6.65\% $LA_{eq}$ decrease) but minimal reductions for low frequencies.

Water features significantly reduced psychoacoustic ``roughness'' (0.023 asper decrease), enhancing soundscape pleasantness despite high SPL.

Rooftop gardens emerged as the optimal solution for high-rise dwellings, while trees and facades remain viable ground-level options. Psychoacoustic analysis proved critical, revealing trade-offs between audibility reduction and low-frequency vibration control. These findings inform sustainable urban design in land-scarce cities, with an emphasis on urban noise mitigation.
